      <description>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the time to write, but I also lost all the source files for this site. Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with getting a simple python script up and running for collecting rss data and reposting it, and setting up bit warden&amp;hellip; all on my personal page.

      <title>simplifying tech</title>

      <description>Foundational environment
There is alot to say about simplifying one’s environment. While I’ve known this was so, it was only recently that I truly understood its meaning. I’ve been battling (aka distro hopping) the nagging need to try out the latest and greatest. All a while, watching my knowledge on particular sets of technologies dwindle. I have strived to be a profencent programmer/developer/engineer.
Well, with all that said, I’d like to profess that I’m going to stick with OpenBSD for a while.</description>

      <title>Bouncing back from clearlinux</title>

      <description>I guess I got seduced by the hype around ClearLinux recently and decided to install it on over my OpenBSD OS disk. I’ve heard it was a great OS with great Intel hardware support…especially since it’s coming from Intel. This is not a “normal” linux OS, there are a bunch of things/technologies baked into this OS that is a bit different. There are just too many details for this post, but clearlinux.</description>

      <title>Re re-do my laptop</title>

      <description>Yeah, I’ve bounded a couple of times over the past week, distro bouncing that is. I tried out Fedora 30, Ubuntu 16.10, and even Pop_OS!. All of which worked just fine on this laptop, but I find myself back with OpenBSD.
I don’t know why I got through these bouts with settling on an OS. For now, it has been more a distraction than a useful experiment to gain exposure in the Linux landscape.</description>

      <description>Well, I have not been doing much tech today. Not really. I reformatted my primary laptop with the latest OpenBSD. I’ve been fond of this OS for quite a while, primarily due to the simplicity of the file structure and service management system.</description>

      <title>A little workflow</title>

      <description>Given that this site is statically created (aka re-created) after each post, it makes since to me that I need to make this as automated as possible. My first thought is to archive the entire site, which should only be a few kilobytes, take a hash of the archive and use those details to validated it on the server side before posting. I could create a couple of small bash/sh scripts to make it all work, but it should be fairly straight forward.</description>

      <title>Automation needs to be priority</title>

      <description>My first post went, well meh… I got the writing done fairly easily, but the actual posting process is a bit more involved. I basically ended up building the site in my dev environment, archiving the public directory, uploading it, and extact it on a public accessible server.
So, now I’ll need to focus on creating some automation into a usable workflow to make posting easy. More to come.</description>

      <description>My first post…
Well, it has been a very long time since I’ve written. And, I’ve never had a blog. My wife has been a somewhat frequent blogger for a while and had recently become more active. She is obviously a much more prolific writer than I, but I’ll do my best.
This blog is meant to help me documenat my journey while exploring various software and technologies that I come across.</description>
