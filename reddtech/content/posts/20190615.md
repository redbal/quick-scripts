Foundational environment

There is alot to say about simplifying one’s environment. While I’ve known this was so, it was only recently that I truly understood its meaning. I’ve been battling (aka distro hopping) the nagging need to try out the latest and greatest. All a while, watching my knowledge on particular sets of technologies dwindle. I have strived to be a profencent programmer/developer/engineer.

Well, with all that said, I’d like to profess that I’m going to stick with OpenBSD for a while. I should be able to sort out any technical needs between the Ubuntu laptop and a SmartOS environment with loads of VMs.
