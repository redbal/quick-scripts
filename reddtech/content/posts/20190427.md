My first post went, well meh… I got the writing done fairly easily, but the actual posting process is a bit more involved. I basically ended up building the site in my dev environment, archiving the public directory, uploading it, and extact it on a public accessible server.

So, now I’ll need to focus on creating some automation into a usable workflow to make posting easy. More to come.
