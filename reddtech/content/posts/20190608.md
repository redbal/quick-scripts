I guess I got seduced by the hype around ClearLinux recently and decided to install it on over my OpenBSD OS disk. I’ve heard it was a great OS with great Intel hardware support…especially since it’s coming from Intel. This is not a “normal” linux OS, there are a bunch of things/technologies baked into this OS that is a bit different. There are just too many details for this post, but clearlinux.org has all the details.
