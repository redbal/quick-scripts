My first post…

Well, it has been a very long time since I’ve written. And, I’ve never had a blog. My wife has been a somewhat frequent blogger for a while and had recently become more active. She is obviously a much more prolific writer than I, but I’ll do my best.

This blog is meant to help me documenat my journey while exploring various software and technologies that I come across. I’ll probably start off with my current lab configuration.

Yes, I know…it’s a crude sketch, and it’s proof that Dia is still alive. Regardless, this is a quick representation of the lab environment I’m working in.
