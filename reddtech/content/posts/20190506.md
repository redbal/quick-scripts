Yeah, I’ve bounded a couple of times over the past week, distro bouncing that is. I tried out Fedora 30, Ubuntu 16.10, and even Pop_OS!. All of which worked just fine on this laptop, but I find myself back with OpenBSD.

I don’t know why I got through these bouts with settling on an OS. For now, it has been more a distraction than a useful experiment to gain exposure in the Linux landscape. I don’t know if that even makes sense right now as I’m running a little low on the brain juices. Regardless, I wanted to get this out.
