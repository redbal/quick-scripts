Given that this site is statically created (aka re-created) after each post, it makes since to me that I need to make this as automated as possible. My first thought is to archive the entire site, which should only be a few kilobytes, take a hash of the archive and use those details to validated it on the server side before posting. I could create a couple of small bash/sh scripts to make it all work, but it should be fairly straight forward. Perhaps this would be a good project for some python as well.
